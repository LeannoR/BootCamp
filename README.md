# BootCamp
I developed a game similar to Fun Race 3D. In this game player tries to go finish line while avoiding different type of traps, such as opening and moving doors, knifes, rocks, axes, and spikes. I developed this game for my final project of Techcareer Game Developer bootcamp.This repository has two brances. Everything is on master branch.
